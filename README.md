# Functional Programming Application Framework

## Inspiration

- Railway Oriented Programming. Result (either)  (neverthrow)
- Persistence Ignorant Domain
- Rich Domain Model
- Clean Architecture, ports and adapters
- Command/Query Handlers
- Domain Driven Design
- Domain Events (and Integration Events)
- Screaming Architecture
- Dependency Injection (IoC), but lightweight, just enough to manage some lifecycles (singleton and scoped)

## Run Sample

- `yarn`
- `yarn start`

## Run compile/lint/test

- `yarn testsuite`

Access over `http://localhost:3535/train-trip` (see `TrainTrip.router.ts` for paths and methods)

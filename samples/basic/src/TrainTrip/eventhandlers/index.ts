// Domain Events should primarily be used to be turned into Integration Event (Post-Commit, call other service)
// There may be other small reasons to use it, like to talk to an external system Pre-Commit.
// Otherwise they just add additional layers of indirection and take behavior away often more suited for the Aggregrates/root.
// Informing other bounded contexts, generally should not occur within the same transaction, and should thus be handled
// by turning into Integration Events.

// Ideas: Store Integration Events into the database within the same Commit, and process them in an outside service.
// So that we may ensure the events will be processed.
// Other options can be to have a compensating action running regularly that checks and fixes things. A sort of eventual consistency.

// There are some pitfalls: when turning into an integration event callback
// one should generally not access dependencies that were passed into the domain event :/
// because of possible scope mismatch issues (ie a db context should be closed after a request has finished processing).
// Below implementations violate this principal, at the time of writing ;-)
// (trainTripPublisher is passed in as part of the domain event handler, and used by the integration event handler)
